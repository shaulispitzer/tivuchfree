        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Welcome to Tivuch Free</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
            At Tivuch Free, we believe that finding a dira, already an expensive
            endeavor, shouldn’t come with an additional hefty price tag. Our
            mission is simple: to help couples and families in Yerushalayim find
            their perfect apartments without the burden of paying exorbitant
            Tivuch fees.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
            The idea for Tivuch Free was born out of a personal experience.
            After navigating the frustrating and expensive process of finding an
            apartment, and ultimately paying an excessive tivuch fee, we
            realized that there had to be a better way.<br />

            With the encouragement of Rabbanim shlit”a, we decided to create a
            free platform that empowers couples and families in Yerushalayim,
            the majority living on already stretched Kollel budgets, to find
            their perfect dira without the additional and unnecessary financial
            strain that often accompanies it
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">What We Offer</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
            No Brokerage Fees: We connect you directly with property owners and
            trusted landlords, eliminating the middleman and saving you from
            unnecessary expenses.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
            User-Friendly Experience: We’ve designed our site with you in mind.
            Our easy-to-navigate interface and advanced search filters make it
            simple to find exactly what you’re looking for. As part of our goal
            to cater to the whole community, we have created a phone line where
            apartment hunters with no internet access can hear all available
            listings. Similarly, Baalei Dira can list either online or over the
            phone.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
            Community Focused: We understand the importance of community. Our
            listings include detailed neighborhood information to help you find
            a place where you and your family will feel right at home.
